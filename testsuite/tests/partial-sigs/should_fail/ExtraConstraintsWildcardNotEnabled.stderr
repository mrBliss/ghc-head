    Found hole ‘_’ with inferred constraints: Show a
    Where: ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
               the inferred type of show' :: Show a => a -> String
               at ExtraConstraintsWildcardNotEnabled.hs:4:10
    To use the inferred type, enable PartialTypeSignatures
    In the type signature for ‘show'’: show' :: _ => a -> String
